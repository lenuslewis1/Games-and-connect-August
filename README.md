## Environment Variables (Cloudinary / Email)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local`) and fill in:

```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_general_unsigned_preset   # used for event flyers
VITE_CLOUDINARY_GALLERY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_gallery_unsigned_preset  # optional override just for gallery (falls back to general preset)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=flyers

# EmailJS
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=...
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_event_registration
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=...
```

Gallery uploader will attempt these presets (in order):
1. `VITE_CLOUDINARY_GALLERY_UPLOAD_PRESET` (if set)
2. `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
3. `website-upload`, `gallery-upload`, `ml_default`, `unsigned_preset`, `unsigned`

At least one unsigned preset must exist in your Cloudinary dashboard and allow the resource type(s) you upload (image / video). Ensure the preset allows the folder `gallery/` (or leave folder blank for all) and unsigned uploads.
