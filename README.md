```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_general_unsigned_preset   # used for event flyers

Gallery uploader will attempt these presets (in order):

2. `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
3. `website-upload`, `gallery-upload`, `ml_default`, `unsigned_preset`, `unsigned`

At least one unsigned preset must exist in your Cloudinary dashboard and allow the resource type(s) you upload (image / video). Ensure the preset allows the folder `gallery/` (or leave folder blank for all) and unsigned uploads.
